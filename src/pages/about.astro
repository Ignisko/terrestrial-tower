    <p>
      i'm passionate about learning and exploring new technologies. recently, i've
      been diving into web development, starting with basic courses on w3schools
      and MIT's computer science lectures. i'm currently working through astro's
      introductory tutorial, and this is the second page on my website i built myself!).
    </p>

    <h2>my astro journey</h2>

    <p>
      i like astro. it works.
    </p>

    <p>
      learning a lot.
    </p>

    <h2>challenges and successes</h2>

    <p>
      like any new technology, astro has presented some challenges. i've had to
      overcome some hurdles with setting up my development environment and
      understanding certain concepts. for example, my old laptop couldn't handle
      running astro projects, and i experienced a lot of crashes. however, with
      the help of the astro documentation, community, and resources like youtube
      and chatgpt, i've been able to overcome these challenges and achieve some
      early successes. i even learned how to run my website locally using
      powershell. i'm also grateful for the help i received from luis on the
      astro discord server.
    </p>

    <h2>looking ahead</h2>

    <p>
      this site will update as i complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
      back and see how my journey is going! i plan to share tutorials, tips, and
      insights that i gain along the way. i also hope to connect with other astro
      developers and learn from their experiences.
    </p>

    <p>here are a few facts about me:</p>

        <li>
          two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}
        </li>
      )}
    </ul>
