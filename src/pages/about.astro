  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>I'm passionate about learning and exploring new technologies. Recently, I've been diving into web development, starting with basic courses on W3Schools and MIT's computer science lectures. I'm currently working through Astro's introductory tutorial, and this is the second page on my website (and the first one I built myself!).</p>

  <h2>My Astro Journey</h2>

  <p>I'm excited about Astro because it offers a unique approach to building websites. I can use my favorite UI components and combine them with the power of a static site generator. This means I can create fast, SEO-friendly websites with a modern development experience.</p>

  <p>I'm still in the early stages of my Astro journey, but I've already learned a lot. I've explored Astro's component syntax, its file-based routing system, and its ability to integrate with different data sources. I've also learned how to push my code to a repository and track my progress.</p>

  <h2>Challenges and Successes</h2>

  <p>Like any new technology, Astro has presented some challenges. I've had to overcome some hurdles with setting up my development environment and understanding certain concepts. For example, my old laptop couldn't handle running Astro projects, and I experienced a lot of crashes. However, with the help of the Astro documentation, community, and resources like YouTube and ChatGPT, I've been able to overcome these challenges and achieve some early successes. I even learned how to run my website locally using PowerShell. I'm also grateful for the help I received from Luis on the Astro Discord server.</p>

  <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

  <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going! I plan to share tutorials, tips, and insights that I gain along the way. I also hope to connect with other Astro developers and learn from their experiences.</p>
